## About

> I consider myself a proactive, intelligent, and curious person.

 I love to give the best of myself and learn in every situation. Since I was little I have been atracted to technologies, which has made me learn programming by my own and later study and finish the Master Degree on Computer Engineering. I really value good relationships, and I consider myself with great capability to learn things other than computer science. Also I made some exchange trips because of improve my english level. Finally, among other hobbies I like to play the piano and do yoga and also I have my own car and I'm an independent person.
